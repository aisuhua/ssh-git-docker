You can find here Dockerfiles for building OpenSSH server images + installed git.

== ssh-git-openshift

OpenSSH runs as the `git` user. Suitable for OpenShift non-privileged usage.

== ssh-git-user

OpenSSH runs as the `git` user. Can run in OpenShift only in privileged mode.

== ssh-git-root

OpenSSH run as root. Can run in OpenShift only in privileged mode.
Advantage is that you can configure multiple users with that image.

Not very suitable for persistance yet. Using them for testing presently.
TODO: modify and add ability to use persistent volumes.
